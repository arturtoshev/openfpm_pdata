 * # Get the signed distance function for a 3D sphere via Sussman Redistancing #
 *
 * In this example, we perform Sussman redistancing on a filled 3D sphere. Here, the sphere is constructed via
 * equation. For image based reconstruction and redistancing see @ref example_sussman_images_3D.
 *
 * A filled sphere with center a, b, c can be constructed by the following equation:
 *
 *
 * @f[ (x-a)^2 + (y-b)^2 + (z-c)^2 <= r^2 @f]
 *
 * We will create a filled sphere on a 3D grid, where the sphere is represented by a -1/+1 step function
 * (indicator function) as:
 *
 * @f[ \phi_{\text{indicator}} = \begin{cases}
 *    +1 & \text{point lies inside the object} \\
 *     0 & \text{object surface} \\
 *    -1 & \text{point lies outside the object} \\
 * \end{cases} @f]
 *
 * By Sussman redistancing, this indicator function is transformed into a signed distance function:
 *
 * @f[ \phi_{\text{SDF}} = \begin{cases}
 *    +d & \text{orthogonal distance to the closest surface of a point lying inside the object} \\
 *     0 & \text{object surface} \\
 *    -d & \text{orthogonal distance to the closest surface of a point lying outside the object} \\
 * \end{cases} @f]
 *
 * Once we have received the Phi_SDF from the redistancing, particles can be placed on narrow band around the interface.
 *
 * * Creates filled 3D sphere with -1/+1 indicator function
 * * Runs Sussman redistancing (see @ref RedistancingSussman.hpp)
 * * Places particles on narrow band around interface
 *
 * Output:
 * print on promt : Iteration, Change, Residual (see: #DistFromSol::change, #DistFromSol::residual)
 * writes vtk and hdf5 files of:
 * 1.) 3D grid with sphere pre-redistancing and post-redistancing (Phi_0 and Phi_SDF, respectively)
 * 2.) particles on narrow band around interface

	 * * \p interval_check_convergence: Interval of #iterations at which convergence to steady state is checked
	 *                                  (Default: 100).
	 * * \p width_NB_in_grid_points: Width of narrow band in number of grid points. Must be at least 4, in order to
	 *                               have at least 2 grid points on each side of the interface. Is automatically set
	 *                               to 4, if a value smaller than 4 is chosen (Default: 4).

	 *                                        w.r.t the previous iteration and the residual is printed (Default: false).
